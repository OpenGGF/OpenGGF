# OpenGGF 0.7.prerelease — Development changelog

Unreleased. The earlier development themes remain in
[CHANGELOG.0.7.md](CHANGELOG.0.7.md).

## Gameplay and presentation

- **S3K level entry:** Captures that omit the title presentation complete the
  destination's deferred player assembly before its animation and art-loading
  tail, allowing ordinary movement after a fresh zone handoff. Publication also
  restores the destination ring count after the title boundary temporarily
  retains the source count, including rewind across that boundary.

- **S3K Knuckles entry:** Locked-on Mushroom Hill deletes the standalone S&K
  intro before it can freeze the camera and take player control. Its native
  `SK_alone_flag` prerequisite is kept separate from the selected character.
