- **Scripted website hero reels:** `tools/media/hero_reels.py` regenerates
  the Sonic 1, Sonic 2 and Sonic 3&K title-card reels from the current engine
  with one command. It replaces the hand-cut 0.6 Resolve edits. Each game's shot
  list is a committed manifest. Each shot replays a committed trace fixture or
  BK2 headlessly, and shots are joined with hard cuts. The build fails on a
  missing ROM, a short, black or frozen shot, or a death inside a shot. It
  writes a poster, a contact sheet and provenance (engine commit, manifest hash,
  frame ranges) beside each reel.
