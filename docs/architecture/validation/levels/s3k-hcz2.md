# S3K Hydrocity Act 2 coverage matrix

Canonical binding: `S3K_HYDROCITY_2`, engine zone 1/act 1, ROM `$0101`, S3KL object set.
Edges: HCZ1 incoming structural act handoff; MGZ1 outgoing full entry.
Character routes: Knuckles and Sonic/Tails use different native starts and end-route contexts.

Status: in progress. The bounded normal-entry and graph floor below is qualified; the act is not certified.
Supported production presets are 320/352/400/528/800 via `WidescreenAspect` and `resolveDisplayAspect`. Configured main/donor support is off×{Sonic,Tails,Knuckles}, S1×Sonic and S2×{Sonic,Tails}. `LaunchProfile.sanitizedFor` owns configured fallback; script-created NPCs have their own native registration/art authority. Configured comma rosters are uncapped by `ActiveGameplayTeamResolver.parseConfiguredSidekicks`; pair, mixed, duplicate and declared large-roster examples do not establish a maximum.

The initial native/default binding covers all three solo mains at 320; the finite product follow-up extends that floor. The 140 finite normal-entry products below now qualify all five production presets, supported main/donor pairs and solo/pair/mixed/duplicate/seven-follower examples. Independent actual death/reload now qualifies the same 140 supported products. Other entry mechanisms, physical posts, mechanic-specific authority and route composition remain separate obligations. Raw 512/640 injection, when used by older local tests, is custom geometry evidence rather than production-preset coverage.

## Obligations

| Obligation | Contract / existing binding | Current evidence and shortest remaining action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ENTRY / CAMERA: normal character start and current focus | `Sonic_Start_Locations` / `Knux_Start_Locations`; [`TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix#normalEntryAppliesTheProductionPresetAndEveryDeclaredParticipantThenReplaysTwice`](../../../../src/test/java/com/openggf/tests/TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix.java) | 140 supported products: actual host-ROM start table, all resolved production widths, typed admitted roster/ordered CPU leaders/current native P2 and camera focus, decoded current mappings and unchanged P1 lives. This is a fresh entry floor, not every intro/alternate-entry mechanism. |
| REWIND: normal entry world | Complete registered-world capture/restore and 45 ordinary Right-input frames twice; all title-card pattern bytes compared by content | Qualified for all 140 finite products. Held Right is requalified by the 2026-10-17 input correction below; the 2026-10-14 runs held Down. No P1 death or hidden life loss is permitted. This does not certify later event/interaction/child lifetimes or cross-load history policy. |
| OBJECT / EVENT / CAMERA: raised floor, wall and twisting loop | `TestS3kHcz2RaisedFloorWallCollisionHeadless`, `TestS3kHcz2TwistingLoopRegression`, `TestS3kHcz2SpindashStuckRegression`, `TestSonic3kHCZEvents` | Positioned/event regressions; cold traversal and five-preset/donor/roster interaction products remain open. Listed bindings were setup-inspected, not independently rerun as a whole in this slice. |
| BOSS / REWIND: end boss and water columns | `TestS3kHczEndBossGraphRewind`, `TestHczEndBossInstance`, `TestHczEndBossWaterColumnControlPolicy` | Component/arena graph checks; actual arena admission, completion and outgoing lifecycle breadth remain separate. Listed bindings were setup-inspected, not independently rerun as a whole in this slice. |
| LIFE / LOAD: physical post, actual death/restart and incoming/outgoing worlds | Native checkpoint/death/reload owners and the edges listed above | All 140 supported preset/donor/main/roster products are qualified by `TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix#actualDeathReloadPreservesTheSupportedProductAndReplaysEachIncomingWorldTwice`: two actual deaths/reloads, exactly one life lost per restart, new world owners, outgoing live-history retirement, restored current roster/camera and two complete-world 45-frame restore/replay cycles after each released destination. Physical post activation and incoming/outgoing route edges remain separate obligations. |
| PRESENT: actual viewport, palette/scroll/plane and audio | Act-owned ROM art/AniPLC/AnPal/event and music/SFX owners | Decoded playable source is checked at entry. Scene pixels, native audiovisual timing and viewport-edge parity require their own bounded native/GPU evidence. |
| ROUTE: representative completion and compatibility axes | Authentic entry→mandatory mechanics→boss/results→released next state | Complete character-route composition, every preset/donor axis and applicable team-shape traversals remain open; short entry is not route certification. |
| ORACLE: timing-sensitive native behavior | `TestS3kSonicTailsHcz2SegmentTraceReplay`, `TestS3kTailsFullChainHcz2SegmentTraceReplay` | Preserve each owning strict-ledger result/source. Comparison rows do not supply gameplay; no strict trace or conformance sweep was run here. |

## Directed typing section — 2026-10-25

The [Typing integration record](../../designs/2026-10-09-typing-of-the-hedgehog.md#develop-integration-and-route-authoring-2026-10-25)
qualifies a separate 400-pixel, native solo Sonic mod presentation. Its spatial
entry beyond the wall chase now waits on a read-only query of the existing
background transition/refresh owner before holding the world. No native event
state, dispatch, timer or ordinary entry behavior is replaced. The affected
course completes and retries, and `TestTypingHedgehogSectionRendering` checks
Boss Rush terrain/body pixels, native low priority, underwater palette reveal,
held clocks, published SAT and snapshot preservation. The final focused case
passes without skips; the combined required S3K/course/API gate passes 102 cases
without skips. This adds no stock-route, other-character/donor/team, other-width,
physical-post, native audiovisual timing or full-act parity qualification.

## Qualification — 2026-10-14

Base/runtime lineage: `5b2ff8e78`; branch tip before this slice `390ebd765`, plus this commit’s explicit native-scripted art owner and test. Worktree `.worktrees/ai-s3k-parity-hpz`, Java 25.0.4.1, all three original ROMs by absolute path, `env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null`.

`python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off -Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl "-Dtest=TestS3kCanonicalEntryLifecycle,TestLevelPlayableArtInitializerModArt,TestDonorTailsTailBanks,TestSpriteManagerRewindCapture,TestS3kCnzSoloCarryInHeadless,TestS3kAiz1SkipHeadless,TestSonic3kLevelLoading,TestSonic3kBootstrapResolver,TestSonic3kDecodingUtils"` with `-Ds3k.rom.path`, `-Dsonic1.rom.path`, `-Dsonic2.rom.path`, then `test`: request 31958 completed 10:58:41 BST (09:58:41 UTC), 169 tests/0 failures/0 errors/0 skips, Maven 37.197 s. The new class contributes 70 cases/0/0/0 (7.070s); these are bounded focused checks, not broad smoke/full-suite certification. No integration/push is claimed by this local record.

The shared selection’s first measured CNZ NPC art failure, rejected alternatives and coherent correction are recorded in the [CNZ1 matrix](s3k-cnz-act1.md). They do not imply a new native scene-parity qualification for this act.

## Finite normal-entry products — 2026-10-14

The independent per-act class above supplies 140 distinct rows: native 75, S1 Sonic 20, S2 Sonic 25 and S2 Tails 20, each spanning 320/352/400/528/800 production presets. Solo, supported single follower, mixed two, duplicate two and declared seven-follower examples deduplicate only when donor character support makes rows identical. Unsupported follower names are explicitly substituted by the generator's declared Sonic intent; that is not a menu fallback or a participant cap. Every admitted identity and CPU leader is checked at entry and every ordinary/replay step. Two full-world restore/45-frame forward cycles remain in the same loaded world.

The eight-act/animation-consumer request 83519 on `6e9d951aa` plus the initial carry-art candidate completed 1186 tests/1 failure/8 errors/0 skips at 11:44:40 BST (10:44:40 UTC), Maven 1m53s. All seven other acts passed their 140 rows (CNZ1 also passed 3 native mixed/duplicate/seven-follower carry-authority vectors). AIZ2 passed 139/140; its S2-Tails/800/seven-Sonic case reordered player refs 3/5 in AutoSpin's unordered identity map during immediate restoration. Separately, 8 mocked art-manager consumers exposed a bridge-dispatch setup issue, corrected by the carry slice and its 61-case gate. These consumer errors do not erase the completed per-act rows and are not described as a green invocation.

After qualified carry art `a54c1a8ae`, Root's collision dependency `eea476471` and canonical player-key map capture dependency `e77b387a3` were adopted as `6c5ae479d`/`cacd63b77`. The valid-source follow-up request 30705 completed 163/0/0/0 at 12:06:02 BST (11:06:02 UTC), Maven 1m23s: AIZ2's complete 140 rows, player-reference codec 5, AIZ2 object codec 3, object-manager snapshot 11 and carried-art/handoff 4. Its exact selector is `TestS3kAiz2EntryMatrix,TestRewindPlayerReferenceCodecs,TestNativeCarriedPlayerArtBinding,TestAiz2ObjectRewindCodecs,TestObjectManagerRewindSnapshot`. All use the local queued lean wrapper, `-Dmse=off`, surfaceless EGL, unset DISPLAY/WAYLAND_DISPLAY, null OpenAL and original absolute S1/S2/S3K ROM properties. An earlier dependent request was accidentally submitted during dependency prose conflicts and was canceled at compilation with exit 130; it executed no tests and earns no behavioral credit.

Thus 1120 distinct normal-entry rows are qualified through retained 980 unaffected rows and the repaired AIZ2 source's 140, with explicit source scope; this is not one pristine 1120-case green run. No current native pixel, strict trace, physical post, death/reload, incoming/outgoing lifecycle or whole-act completion claim follows from this entry product. The listed remaining mechanic, route and presentation obligations stay open.

## Independent actual restart floor — 2026-10-14

[`TestS3kCanonicalDeathLifecycle`](../../../../src/test/java/com/openggf/tests/TestS3kCanonicalDeathLifecycle.java) independently boots this actual act binding, native 320 solo Sonic, then invokes the production pit-death owner twice. It writes no position, clock, ring, life, checkpoint or destination state. Each real `GameLoop` reload replaces the object/runtime owner, costs exactly one life, restores the current typed roster, resolved camera width and P1 focus, and retires nonempty outgoing live history. Title/fade/fresh assembly release is required separately from any intrinsic intro control. Each released same-world destination has immediate full-registry restoration and two 45-frame neutral forward cycles; no raw snapshot crosses the load.

Qualified source: `5d334596e` (includes early donor boot, frozen native camera and single production fade ownership) plus this commit's private dead-main mask correction and the two new death test classes. Queued lean request 40522 completed 12:59:51 BST (11:59:51 UTC), Maven 1m16s: 247 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 0 skips. The eight-act floor contributes 8 cases; `TestMainDeathVerticalWrap` contributes 18 literal main-motion/real-roster/live-mask cases; existing death/radius/movement/CPU rewind, reverse-gravity and S1 LZ3 wrap neighbors contribute 221. Command: `python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py --lean -Dmse=off -Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl "-Dtest=TestMainDeathVerticalWrap,TestDeathRestartRoutineParity,TestDeathRadiusTransition,TestS3kCanonicalDeathLifecycle,TestS3kReverseGravityBoundary,TestS1Lz3VerticalWrap,TestPlayableSpriteMovement,TestSidekickCpuControllerRewindCapture"`, original absolute S1/S2/S3K ROM properties, then `test`; DISPLAY/WAYLAND_DISPLAY unset and `ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null`.

This is the independently executed native 320/Sonic restart floor, not the remaining finite lifecycle cross-product, physical pit traversal, post activation, route completion, native pixels or a strict trace sweep. Shared-change smoke, integration and push remain lead-owned and pending. The [MGZ1 record](s3k-mgz-act1.md#native-main-death-wrap-owner-correction-2026-10-14) retains the measured gameplay blocker and rejected partial repair.

## Finite actual restart products — 2026-10-14

[`TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix#actualDeathReloadPreservesTheSupportedProductAndReplaysEachIncomingWorldTwice`](../../../../src/test/java/com/openggf/tests/TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix.java) reuses the separately qualified production death driver, independently of the normal-entry method. The same 140 supported rows cover all five resolved production presets, native/S1/S2 main support and solo/single/mixed/duplicate/seven-follower shapes. Each row boots this actual act, advances ordinary neutral inputs, invokes the semantic pit-death owner twice, requires exactly one life lost and replacement object/runtime owners on each real reload, and checks the current typed roster, CPU leader order, native P2 and camera width/focus after assembly. Nonempty outgoing live history must retire. No position, gameplay counter, checkpoint, destination or callback state is supplied to rescue the scenario.

After each title/fade/fresh-assembly release, the complete registered world is captured, advanced for 45 neutral logical ticks, restored immediately and replayed twice. Each forward tick checks P1 survival, unchanged lives and actual configured owners. Intrinsic intro control remains native-owned; this is not a forced unlock or a raw restore across the load. Physical pit traversal, physical post capture/respawn, completion edges and later mechanic lifetimes remain separate.

One coherent focused invocation qualified all eight acts: command session54147 on runtime `e57236d519a861c9fbc43ba867230793dbd6fb0d` plus this commit's nine test-only deltas, 1120 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 0 skips (each act 140/0/0/0), actual terminal exit0 at 13:42:47 BST (12:42:47 UTC), Maven 3m05s. Exact selection: `TestS3kAiz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kMgz1EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kMgz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kCnz1EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kCnz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kIcz1EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kIcz2EntryMatrix`, each restricted with `#actualDeathReloadPreservesTheSupportedProductAndReplaysEachIncomingWorldTwice` in the comma-separated `-Dtest` selector. Command prefix: `env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py --lean -Dmse=off -Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl`; original absolute S1/S2/S3K ROM properties were supplied, followed by `test`. Entry rows were not rerun merely to repeat their unchanged evidence. This is finite lifecycle qualification, not complete act, native-pixel, strict-trace or arbitrary roster certification; combined smoke/integration/push remain lead-owned.

## Entry replay input correction — 2026-10-17

`CanonicalEntryMatrixSupport.advanceEntry(fixture, row, frames, right)` passed its `right` flag as the second argument of `HeadlessTestFixture.stepFrame(up, down, left, right, jump)` in every committed revision from the helper's introduction in `a54c1a8ae` through `0197c5a5a`. The `#normalEntryAppliesTheProductionPresetAndEveryDeclaredParticipantThenReplaysTwice` runs recorded above on those sources therefore held **Down**, not Right, in each 45-frame capture/replay window, so a grounded P1 ducked in place instead of moving. Request 83519's uncommitted initial candidate cannot be inspected here; treat its replay input as unverified rather than as Right. Those records keep their original commands, sources and counts and remain evidence within that Down-held scope: actual start table, owners, survival, unchanged lives and full-world restore/replay equality. They did not exercise held-Right movement, the camera scroll it causes or the object placement that scroll admits. The restart products' post-release windows were already neutral and are not affected.

The helper now passes the flag as `right`. [`TestS3kCanonicalEntryRightInput`](../../../../src/test/java/com/openggf/tests/TestS3kCanonicalEntryRightInput.java) drives the same helper on native 320 solo Sonic in CNZ2, whose start is grounded on flat floor, and checks the production joypad path on each of 45 frames (Right held; Up, Down and Left absent; not crouching). It then requires P1 still grounded with `ground_vel` 45 × `$C` (`Sonic_Move` adds `Acceleration` for `button_right` in `Ctrl_1_held_logical`) and forward movement.

Corrected qualification, all on `0197c5a5a` plus this commit's test-only deltas (helper SHA-1 `49e31e0026db`), command prefix `env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null python3 <main-workspace>/tools/testing/maven_queue.py --lean -Dmse=off -Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl`, original absolute S1/S2/S3K ROM properties, then `test`:

- Eight-act entry selection: `-Dtest` lists `TestS3kAiz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kHcz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kMgz1EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kMgz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kCnz1EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kCnz2EntryMatrix`, `TestS3kIcz1EntryMatrix` and `TestS3kIcz2EntryMatrix`, each restricted with `#normalEntryAppliesTheProductionPresetAndEveryDeclaredParticipantThenReplaysTwice`, plus the first version of the input test. It finished at 02:02:24 UTC after a 193 s queue wait and 1m46s of Maven: 1121 tests / 1 failure / 0 errors / 0 skips. Every act passed 140/0/0/0 with held Right. The one failure was the input test's own premise. It first used MGZ1, whose Sonic start (ROM `$C0,$F00`) is airborne, so `ground_vel` stays zero while air control raises `x_vel` by 24 each frame. The test was moved to CNZ2; the helper was not changed.
- Revised input test with the helper restored to its `0197c5a5a` bytes: fails at Right frame 0 (`isRightPressed` false), 02:04:26–02:05:01 UTC, 1 test / 1 failure / 0 errors / 0 skips.
- Revised input test with the fix: 02:05:15–02:05:44 UTC, 1 test / 0 failures / 0 errors / 0 skips.

Death/reload products, combined smoke and integration were not rerun here. This requalifies the held-Right entry floor only; it is not act certification.

## Object pipeline optimization — 2026-10-22

HCZ column selection retains native lifetime/replacement and rewind ownership while
removing repeated query/order work. See the [performance evidence](../../audits/performance/2026-10-22-object-pipeline-performance.md)
for exact focused commands, results and structural counts. This local component
change adds no cold-route, donor/roster, viewport, native-picture or lifecycle
product beyond the obligations already recorded above.


## Shared hand-launcher phase correction — 2026-10-25

The [HCZ1 repair record](s3k-hcz1-sonic.md#launcher-and-chopper-continuity-repairs--2026-10-25)
changes the shared hand launcher to resolve solid contact after motion and retain
prior-pass per-player standing for grab/release and rewind. The current
`TestS3kHcz2TwistingLoopRegression` passes without skips in the87-case focused
selection on base`61be1910` plus those object edits. This is one affected HCZ2
regression, not a new HCZ2 route/width/donor/team/lifecycle or native-pixel claim.
The continuous chain still has an inherited shared player-dispatch frontier;
its later HCZ2 death is not certified fixed by the HCZ1 object work.


HCZ review follow-up (2026-10-25): the existing launcher/Chopper regression
selection now includes real player-pass simultaneous Left/Right consumption
with restore/forward and a manager-level support transfer before the next grab,
also repeated after restore. The 28 affected review cases pass across the final
control and reused unchanged cases. These controls do not certify the still
incomplete continuous route; see the appended HCZ audit for measured limits.


## Primary drowning continuation — 2026-10-25

The shared drowning correction adds 16 independent native-owner controls:
P1 across S1/S2/S3K, P2 in S2/S3K, move-before-gravity, exactly 120 fixed-slot
passes, registered before/after transition restore and forward replay, controlled
wait preservation, carry release, full P2 death marker/manual respawn, and
successful/failed allocation RNG. The affected selection passes 178 physical
cases with zero failures/errors/skips, including all four S3K anchors.

Canonical coverage remains bounded: all three prefixes and standalone AIZ/HCZ
pass, but segment 11 has 31,207 differences, first row 3832 rings 104/94. P2
entry/death/despawn now match native; first P1 motion still differs at miniboss
row 5065. The source segment is the second HCZ1 stint (`hcz_2`); the unexpected
replacement destination at cursor 70718 is HCZ2, generation 9. This adds no HCZ2
route/viewport/donor/team or native-picture qualification. Exact source, commands,
fixture corrections, timing and limits are in the appended HCZ audit. The ring
owner is excluded and the source-proven miniboss loop-entry question is separate.


HCZ miniboss continuation (2026-10-25): next-pass loop entry now has two
independent old-red controls, registered before/pending/initialized recreation
and forward replay, and 91 passing local/anchor cases with no skips. The actual
chain contact at 5065 now matches; first P1 motion moves to the retained Act2
carrier at 6804, with source ownership replacement 71601. The chain remains
1/1F/0E/0S and the first comparison is excluded monitor/rings3832. This qualifies
the local boss entry, not HCZ2 or whole-route breadth; see the appended audit.


HCZ retained-carrier continuation (2026-10-25): native capture retains the
camera-derived target; the corrected HCZ event owner now does too. Independent
P1/P2 old-red and registered before/pending/moving restore controls are qualified
by 110 passing local/anchor cases with no skips. The affected chain walks all
14,208 stored segment-11 rows without the former input-71601 replacement, but
still fails its required giant-ring exit (1/1F/0E/0S), with 137,113 strict
differences and first monitor/rings difference 3832 (104/94). First P1 motion
moves to 8329: a measured held-versus-logical-press error in the HCZ water-skim
handler. This is local progress, not route certification. The existing HCZ audit
records exact source, selectors, queue/execution times and excluded shared
monitor-content lifetime boundary; rings/setup timing remain outside this task.


HCZ skim follow-up and upstream hold (2026-10-25): eight independent P1/P2
held/logical/raw press and registered rewind controls fail on the old guard;
the corrected local selection passes 118/0F/0E/0S, including all four S3K anchors.
Develop then advanced to `08f0a5e78`, which already contains that guard, retained
carrier targets, boss next-pass initialization and independent monitor contents.
No post-skim chain or current-upstream route qualification is claimed. Launcher
and Chopper review corrections and complete drowning ownership still require
receiving-tree reconciliation. See the existing audit's upstream boundary;
parent owns that review, affected replays and combined smoke. This extends no
act/viewport/donor/team or whole-route rewind certification.
