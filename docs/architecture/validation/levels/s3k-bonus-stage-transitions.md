# S3K bonus-stage load and return matrix

Qualification is limited to production boundary pilots on b930df4868 plus
`TestS3kBonusStageReturnProducts`. Request12506 completes2026-10-14 15:17:45 UTC:
all five cases pass, no errors/skips. Exact command and test hashes are in the
[completion plan](../../plans/2026-10-13-s3k-playable-completion.md#ssz-cold-boundaries-and-bonus-return-pilots-2026-10-14).

| Stage | Main / ordered followers | Width / donor | Interior replay | Returned origin replay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gumball | Sonic / Tails |320 / off|Two18-tick whole-world cycles|Two45-tick whole-world cycles|
| Pachinko (Glowing Sphere) |Knuckles / Tails,Sonic|352 / off|Two18-tick whole-world cycles|Two45-tick whole-world cycles|
| Slot Machine |Tails / Sonic,Sonic|400 / off|18 ordinary ticks; whole-stage rewind unsupported|Two45-tick whole-world cycles|
| Gumball |Tails / Sonic,Sonic|800 / S2|Two18-tick whole-world cycles|Two45-tick whole-world cycles|
| Slot Machine |Sonic / Sonic,Sonic|800 / S1|18 ordinary ticks; whole-stage rewind unsupported|Two45-tick whole-world cycles|

Each case boots SOZ1, makes the declared logical stage-entry request and waits
for the actual GameLoop load/title/fade release. It checks coordinator type,
saved origin, fresh object manager, main identity, width and lives. Slot owns
the interior player and removes active followers. A declared requestExit
stimulates completion; the actual load returns to the saved origin, restores
the ordered roster, clears Slot runtime and retires both outgoing timelines.
Full-world comparisons retain every registry key, with both restore directions
and two forward replays. No raw restore crosses a load.

These pilots do not certify cold traversal of the starpost portal, physical
entry, ring/reward/outcome mechanisms, the broader stage mechanisms. The full finite load/return product is qualified
below, including528px and all admitted native/donor main/roster branches. Whole Slot rewind remains an
explicit unsupported contract, not implied by a controller-only snapshot.
Broader stage mechanisms, actual exit causes, load/respawn boundaries and
matched native screenshots/audio remain open.


## Finite load and return products (2026-10-14)

Request70993 completes terminal0 at19:17:41 UTC on coherent
69e4f51d3a37d9517cec3340588daca68b41c1c6 plus the final test draft.
425/0/0/0 passes (4:51 Maven,218.0s test execution;733s queue waiting is separate):
five independent pilots precede420 actual boundary products. The existing
`CanonicalEntryMatrixSupport.configurations()` supplies140 distinct supported
products, deduplicating explicit donor substitutions; this generator is reused
without a new participant cap or unsupported donor combination.

| Axis | Actual product coverage |
|---|---|
| Stage |Gumball, Pachinko/Glowing Sphere, Slot Machine|
| Viewport |320,352,400,528,800|
| Main/donor |Native Sonic/Tails/Knuckles; S1 Sonic; S2 Sonic/Tails|
| Ordered roster |Solo, single, mixed, duplicate and seven-followers; donor-compatible deduplication|
| Entry/return |Production logical request; actual title/fade/load; fresh managers; both history floors|
| Returned world |Exact main/camera identity, ordered CPU leader chain, independent duplicate actors, ROM renderer/animation resources, two45-tick all-key restore/replay cycles|
| Interior |Gumball/Pachinko two18-tick all-key cycles; Slot18 ordinary ticks and its explicitly unsupported whole-stage rewind contract|

Configuration overrides and global session/donor state are restored between
cases. These are actual logical-entry/declared-exit boundary products, not
physical portal approach, winning/reward, whole-interior native picture/audio
or all-mechanism certification. Those obligations remain open. Exact command
and source hash are recorded in the [completion plan](../../plans/2026-10-13-s3k-playable-completion.md#finite-bonus-boundary-qualification-2026-10-14).
