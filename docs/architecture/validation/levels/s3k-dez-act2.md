# S3K Death Egg Zone act 2 coverage matrix

Game / canonical zone / act: S3K `S3K_DEATH_EGG_2`, engine zone `$0B` act index 1,
ROM `Current_zone_and_act = $B01`, SKL object set. **Not Sonic 2's Death Egg.**
Owning plan: [S3K DEZ bring-up](../../plans/2026-09-17-s3k-dez-bring-up.md).
Status: slice 1 (presentation foundation) delivered at `4e7655bf9`. Nothing below certifies the act.

LevelSizes (sonic3k.asm:38120): x `0`-`$6000`, y `0`-`$F10`. The engine's direct `$B01`
load places Sonic at centre `$140,$3AC`, which is also the ROM's post-act-change
transport landing (`loc_7E44C`; `$3B0` when `Player_mode == 2`). Level art
`levartptrs $38,$38,$21` (PLC `$38`, palette `$21`, `ArtKosM_DEZ_Primary` /
`ArtKosM_DEZ2_Secondary`, sonic3k.asm:199456). Music `Sonic3kMusic.DEZ2`.
Placements: 494 objects, 198 rings. All three reverse-gravity writers (`$58`, `$59`,
`$5B`) and the hub `$5C` and retracting spring `$5D` are act-2 only.

Incoming: seamless `$B00` → `$B01` (`loc_593EC`), and a direct load, which starts at
`Events_routine_fg = 4` and `_bg = 8` (`DEZ2_ScreenInit`/`DEZ2_BackgroundInit`), so
`DEZ2_ScreenEvent` stage 0 (chunks `$D7,$DC,$D7`) is reachable seamlessly only.
Outgoing: `Obj_DEZEndBoss` → `StartNewLevel $1700`.

Widths / donors / characters / teams: as act 1. Knuckles is level-select only
(user decision 2026-09-17).

## Five claims

| Claim | State |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | Presentation foundation only: static background, the two shared `AnPal_DEZ2` channels, the eight `AniPLC_DEZ` scripts, both `DEZ2_ScreenEvent` chunk stages and the direct-load routine values |
| Cold-reachable | Not started |
| Rewind-verified | Event routine words only (`TestS3kDezPresentationRewind`) |
| Native behaviour matched | Not started; replay frontiers measured at `035e48a58` below |
| Visually matched | Not started for act 2 specifically; the act 1 clips `01a`-`01d` cover the shared background, palette and tile work |

## Obligations

| PRESENT: `AnPal_DEZ2` channels B and C | Act 2 enters at the `AnPal_DEZ2` label, so channel A (line 4) does **not** run: B `AnPal_PalDEZ12_1` ($3444) → line 3 colours 13-14, C `AnPal_PalDEZ12_2` ($3474) → line 3 colours 8-12 | 320 | `TestS3kDezPaletteCycling`, including a 200-pass check that line 4 never moves | implemented | pass, `4e7655bf9` | Native comparison open |

| GRAVITY: `$58`, `$59`, `$5B` writers | All Player 1 only; `$5B` selected by `render_flags` bit 0 | — | `TestS3kDezGravityObjectsHeadless` | missing | unrun | Slice 3 |
