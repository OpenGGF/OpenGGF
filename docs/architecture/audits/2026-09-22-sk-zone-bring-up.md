# S&K zone bring-up reconciliation

`$PROJECT_ROOT` denotes the absolute main checkout; `$VIDEO_ROOT` denotes the
external OGGF video archive. Commands used absolute resolved ROM paths.

## Scope and baseline

Resume MHZ, FBZ, SOZ, LRZ, SSZ, DEZ and DDZ against their original plans and the
current level-test standard. Main workspace `develop` was fetched and fast-forward
checked at `c91fd5ac70aad2c6cd73dcfc3525d962a45ef4d5` (already current). Preserve
its dirty disassembly submodules and unrelated untracked files.

This is a campaign audit, not zone certification. Historical test/media results
below are inherited evidence until explicitly re-executed. Implementation,
cold reachability, rewind, native behaviour and visual matching remain separate.
Existing ending/credits and route exclusions remain as documented in each plan.

## Reconciled inventory

| Zone | Actual implementation location | Evidence and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MHZ | Integrated in develop; [completion audit](../research/s3k-zones/mhz-completion-audit.md) | Sonic/Tails implementation reviewed, followed by miniboss lifetime/defeat/transition fixes. Original audit explicitly excluded further Knuckles work and stopped traces. No conformant per-act matrix yet; current route, lifecycle, visual and breadth validation still needed. Historical broad failures were not attributed to baseline and must not become a green claim. |
| FBZ | Integrated; [outstanding actions](../research/s3k-zones/fbz-outstanding-actions.md), [Act 1](../validation/levels/s3k-fbz-act1.md), [Act 2](../validation/levels/s3k-fbz-act2.md) | Cold native Act 1 completion and 13 Act 2 completion rows are recorded; bounded reload/transition/rewind and native afterstates exist. Native checkpoint geometry, strict parity, SAT presentation and remaining matrix obligations stay open. Preserve the explicitly accepted S1 elevator challenge. |
| SOZ | Integrated; [plan and evidence](../plans/2026-09-15-soz-methodology-v2.md) | Both acts, bosses and exits implemented; cold-route, recording and native pixel follow-ups greatly exceed the early plan summaries. Full supported route products, remaining lifecycle/participant obligations and native presentation certification need reconciliation against the two act matrices. Trace deferrals are not silently revoked by this audit. |
| LRZ | Local `feature/ai-lrz-bring-up` at `c708e1a2b` | Act 1 census is zero placeholders; miniboss defeat, seamless act change, post-defeat palette/camera releases and Act 2 background stages exist. Act 2 has 23 placeholder placements; boss act has 8. Latest commit adds spike-ball launchers **and an unregistered turbine draft**, absent from the status summary. Remaining turbine/chained platforms, cutscenes, boss act, exits, palette rotation, breadth, rewind, cold completion and native comparisons are substantive work. |
| SSZ | Local `feature/ai-ssz-bring-up` at `55a999030` | Arrival, bridge, traversal families and Act 1 bosses exist. Latest commit adds Mecha Sonic defeat/handover, superseding the media index's claim that defeat is unimplemented. Collapse/launch completion and Knuckles Act 2 still need work. Cold route only reaches the early arrival area; most mechanisms/fights use declared checkpoint setups. Native and wide/rewind acceptance remain incomplete. |
| DEZ | Local `feature/ai-s3k-dez-bring-up` at `b65b5966a` | Reverse gravity plus gravity mechanisms and selected traversal/badnik families implemented. Summary contradicts itself (93 covered reference rows above a stale 34-row table). Seeded Act 2 free-play prefix is 1256 frames, not a cold completion. Act 1, remaining objects, bosses, final act, transitions, missing gravity consumers and acceptance remain open. Latest capture-startup correction must be reviewed alongside other campaigns' tool edits. |
| DDZ | Integrated; [plan](../plans/2026-09-17-ddz-bring-up.md), [matrix](../validation/levels/s3k-ddz.md) | Controller, both boss phases, wrap, death and exit request implemented. Recorded completion declares inherited V-int and camera-fraction seeds; unseeded entry and strict replay bootstrap remain different claims. Existing visual fixes supersede some initial observations; the known-bugs entry still lists stars/HUD/driver issues and needs checking against code. Ending/credits remain outside the original stop line. |

None of the three local campaigns has been merged into develop. Their clean trees
were inspected without mutation. Continuation uses `feature/ai-sk-zone-completion`
in `.worktrees/ai-sk-zone-completion`, created from LRZ with copy-on-write and
merged with the current develop base (`715b46176`, no conflicts). This preserves
the delegated checkouts and keeps incomplete campaigns off the integrated branch.

## Media and historical scratch

Existing archives are under `$VIDEO_ROOT/`: `lrz-bring-up`,
`ssz-bring-up`, `s3k-dez-bring-up`, `ddz-bring-up`, and the HPZ precedent.
Their `INDEX.md`, `notes/`, numbered clips, preserved raw captures and input logs
record positioned versus cold entry. LRZ has a 129.95-second, 18-chapter reel at
`lrz-bring-up/reel/lrz-bring-up-highlights.mp4`. Continue those archives with new
versioned sources; do not overwrite historical footage or treat a reel as a cold run.

The latest LRZ notes correct two misleading blockers: Act 2 lava at camera Y
`$710` is native, and a spindash mismatch was a probe setup artefact. Preserve the
fight palette through the seamless load until `loc_78B08` replaces it at camera
X `$2C0`. SSZ positioned captures require `--star-post` because cold screen init
otherwise overrides the requested position. These are existing findings, not
new diagnoses.

## Current validation and next work

- Preflight initially rejected default Lua 5.5.1. Explicit
  `LUA_BIN=/usr/bin/lua5.4` passes Java/Lua/PowerShell prerequisites in the new
  worktree. No prerequisite bypass or engine change was needed.
- At `715b46176`, queued Maven `-Dmse=off
  -Dtest=TestLrz*,TestS3kLrz*,SwScrlLrzTest,TestFirewormBadnikInstance,TestIwamodokiBadnikInstance,TestToxomisterBadnikInstance,TestS3kAiz1SkipHeadless,TestSonic3kLevelLoading,TestSonic3kBootstrapResolver,TestSonic3kDecodingUtils
  -Ds3k.rom.path=$PROJECT_ROOT/s3k.gen test` completed
  **383 tests, zero failures/errors/skips** on 2026-09-22. Focused validation only.
- Turbine slice now registers both ROM mappings and corrects `sub_44338` to use
  the logical **press** byte. Six focused cases and 17 real-level width/donor/character
  cases passed (23 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, 2026-09-22). The latter cover
  selectable widths 320/352/400/528/800, native/S1/S2 Sonic, and native Tails/Knuckles,
  including whole-world capture/restore/forward replay. Act 2 census is now five
  placeholders: three chained-platform placements, the cutscene and exit.
- Four new positioned turbine captures declare setup/input/width/donor in their
  external provenance files. Clip 37 includes falling into the band, riding and
  releasing; the other three show native/wide/S1 midride starts. State CSV and
  selected PNGs were inspected. Native trajectory/pixel comparison remains open.
- Continue LRZ playable Act 2 and boss-act obligations, then reconcile SSZ and
  DEZ shared changes before integration. Run combined change-based validation
  against the pinned develop SHA, including required domain gates; attribute
  disputed failures narrowly. Do not certify the seven zones from census or
  unit-test counts.

## Rewind findings from the continuation

At LRZ tip `c708e1a2b` and merged baseline `715b46176`, matched queued runs of
`-Pguards -Dtest=TestSonic3kObjectProfileRegistryGuard,TestRewindArchitectureGuard,TestRemainingRewindTailInventory`
confirmed inherited launcher sidecar triage gaps and eight missing restore
constructors. The stale inventory was 1109 classes; actual LRZ added 47. The
initial sweep passed 913, classified 235 as graph-covered, and could not construct
eight. These were not waived by raising the inventory.

The new `TestS3kLrzBossRewindHeadless` first reproduced a missing dynamic reference
while restoring both unfolded arms. Restoration constructors now supply the real
boss parent for its five child classes; three independent LRZ children also gain
normal spawn constructors. The launcher uses the central managed-reference policy
for its ball instead of a custom transient sidecar. A real placed launcher test
removes its in-flight ball, restores it, checks the managed identity and compares
whole-world replay. The focused launcher/miniboss group passed 32 tests with no
failures/errors/skips before extending the boss test further.

Rejected repair: the miniboss's old restore hook synthesized all missing arm
pieces. A new regression killed one hand, waited for its arm to retire, and called
the hook: **12 remaining pieces became 24**. Removed synthesis; the captured
manager/parent graph is authoritative. The old manual-delete/count-only test was
removed because it asserted that incorrect repair rather than snapshot semantics.
`sub_78B46` is the ROM owner of arm retirement.

A second regression at hit-flash creation exposed stale `AbstractBossChild`
`dynamicSpawn` coordinates. Rebuilding only after restore was insufficient: fresh
children could still capture their pre-subclass-constructor `(0,0)` position.
The LRZ effect constructors now publish their initial position; the shared
restore hook refreshes the derived position/ordinal cache after scalar restore. Whole-world tests explicitly remove/recreate all live boss children
at unfolded-arm, hit-flash and defeat-debris phases, then compare restore and next
frame across every registered subsystem. Both tests passed on 2026-09-22 at 15:10
BST. Touches in this test call the production attack entry point only in eligible
phases; this is graph validation, not a controller-driven fight completion.

The shared cache correction requires combined broad validation before integration.
No full-suite success or seven-zone completion is claimed here.

The alternative of refreshing every `getSpawn()` was tested and rejected: it
changed isolated HTZ child-probe behavior (Flamethrower and LavaBall moved from
passed to parent-dependent) without being necessary for the LRZ correction. Keep
the fix at explicit construction and restore boundaries. The final focused queued
`-Pguards -Dtest=TestRemainingRewindTailInventory,TestRewindArchitectureGuard,TestRewindHarnessCoverageRatchet,TestGraphCoveredIsolatedProbeClassification,TestSonic3kObjectProfileRegistryGuard,TestS3kLrzBossRewindHeadless`
with the absolute S3K ROM completed **38 tests, zero failures/errors/skips** at
15:13 BST. The actual inventory is now 1156 = 916 isolated passes + 240 graph-covered,
with all failure buckets empty. This is focused evidence, not a broad suite pass.

The focused shared-boss regression selection
`-Dtest=TestS1*Boss*GraphRewind,TestS2*Boss*GraphRewind,TestS2DeathEggRobotGraphRewind,TestS2MechaSonicGraphRewind,TestS3k*Boss*GraphRewind,TestS3kLrzBossRewindHeadless,TestS3kLrzLauncherRewindHeadless`
with all three absolute ROM paths passed **77 tests, zero failures/errors/skips**
at 15:14 BST. Combined change-based selection remains required before integration.
