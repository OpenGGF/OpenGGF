# Hidden Palace Zone: methodology v2 bring-up plan

Date: 2026-09-16. Branch `feature/ai-hpz-bring-up` in `.worktrees/ai-hpz-bring-up`;
execution base develop `70aa0a0b7`. Applies
[methodology v2](../designs/2026-09-15-zone-methodology-v2.md) to the playable
Hidden Palace act (`$1601`). The Super Emerald sanctuary (`$1701`) was delivered
earlier and is in scope only where the two acts share owners.

## Objective and selection

HPZ was ranked the lowest-effort remaining 0.7 campaign zone (score 5/10) in a
read-only five-zone analysis of LRZ, HPZ, SSZ, DEZ and DDZ on 2026-09-16. The
analysis estimated 43 placed objects in 10 distinct types, no badniks, about 300
lines of event code and two hard objects: `CutsceneKnux_HPZ` and the teleporter
ending. These are source-audit estimates, not measurements.

Deliver ordinary entry, traversal, the Sonic/Tails Knuckles fight and teleporter
exit to SSZ (`$A00`), and the short Knuckles route to SSZ act 2 (`$A01`). Cold
entry uses the data-select destination `LevelList_DA6E` → `$1601`
(`sonic3k.asm:17510`); the ordinary LRZ3 → HPZ transition is blocked until LRZ has
events and remains a recorded gap, not a reason to position the player.

## Findings that changed the plan

- **Identity (fixed, `e3ae26530`).** Engine zone `$16` act 1 resolved the `$1701`
  sanctuary resources, so HPZ was unreachable and its data-select slot entered the
  sanctuary. ROM evidence: sprite table `LRZ3, HPZ, DEZ3, HPZMini`
  (`sonic3k.asm:202440-202443`), screen events `HPZ_*` for `$1601` and `HPZS_*` for
  `$1701` (`102347-102354`), LevelSizes rows (`38141-38144`), title-card selection
  (`62149-62151`). `$1601` now resolves the linear ROM level; the sanctuary keeps
  `$1701`.
- **Research corrections (`8e70761fd`).** `hpz-analysis.md` described `$1701` as the
  main act and placed both slots one zone too high. Its object, event, palette and
  animation descriptions otherwise refer to `HPZ_*` routines and remain the
  starting inventory, subject to reverification.
- **Inherited scroll routing.** `Sonic3kScrollHandlerProvider` selects handlers by zone
  only, so LRZ3 (`$1600`) also receives `SwScrlHpz`. Out of HPZ scope; LRZ work owns it.

## Dependency-ordered slices

| Slice | Scope and ROM owners | Early check and principal risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Identity | Registry, resource profile, title card, art plan, runtime state | Done: `$1601` bounds/object set, `$1701` sanctuary lifecycle unchanged |
| 2. Screen and background events | `HPZ_ScreenInit` / `HPZ_ScreenEvent` (character camera clamps, `Obj_HPZPaletteControl` spawn, screen shake, `Events_fg_4` chunk `$61` write and redraw); `HPZ_BackgroundInit` / `HPZ_BackgroundEvent` (`$EC0` seam redraw machine, Knuckles background patch) | Clamp edges per character; the chunk write goes through `ZoneLayoutMutationPipeline`; seam redraw before/at/after `$EC0` |
| 3. Palette and animated tiles | `AnPal_HPZ`, `AniPLC_HPZ` (4 scripts), `Obj_HPZPaletteControl` (`$B1`, intro → main palette at camera X `$460`) | Line-4 writer order with the Master Emerald; timer/counter phase at entry |
| 4. Placed objects in the playable act | `$B0` Master Emerald and `$B4` Super Emerald placements in `$1601`, generic shared objects | Behaviour outside the sanctuary controller; emerald-state gating |
| 5. Knuckles fight | `$82` subtype `$28` `CutsceneKnux_HPZ` (47 routines), dizzy stars, dust, `mus_Knuckles`, three DPLC sets, collapse via `Events_fg_4` | Registry currently falls back to the AIZ2 cutscene for subtype `$28`; rewind across every state |
| 6. Teleporter and exits | `Obj_SSZHPZTeleporter` (`$79`) full behaviour, camera lock `$1600`, line-4 palette takeover, `StartNewLevel` `$A00`; Knuckles subtype `$4A` save and `$A01` | Handoff into SSZ, which has no events yet: verify the request and load, record the SSZ gap |
| 7. Routes and acceptance | Cold controller routes (Sonic + Tails, Tails, Knuckles), per-act matrix, widths/donors, rewind spots, moving visual inspection | A positioned fight does not advance the cold frontier |

## Status

| Claim | State |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | Slice 1 |
| Cold-reachable | Level load only; no traversal verified |
| Rewind-verified | Not started for `$1601` |
| Native behaviour matched | Not started |
| Visually matched | Not started |

## Evidence log

### 2026-09-16 slice 1 — identity split

Commit `e3ae26530` on base `70aa0a0b7` + `8e70761fd`. Focused command from the
worktree, all three ROMs by absolute path:

```sh
python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off -B -q \
  "-Dtest=TestSonic3kNonlinearHpzProfile,TestSonic3kHpzRuntimeStateRegistration,TestS3kHpzSanctuaryHeadless,TestSonic3kLevelLoading,TestHpzSanctuaryObjects,TestS3kHpzGraphRewind,SwScrlHpzTest,TestS3kAiz1SkipHeadless,TestSonic3kBootstrapResolver,TestSonic3kDecodingUtils" \
  -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false -Ds3k.rom.path=... -Dsonic1.rom.path=... -Dsonic2.rom.path=... test
```

Result from fresh `target/surefire-reports`: 107 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors,
0 skips. Focused validation only. The new `$1601` load test asserts the HPZ
LevelSizes row (`$1880` × `$B20`), which the sanctuary bounds (`$1500-$1640`,
`$320`) cannot satisfy. The sanctuary headless lifecycle cases now run on `$17`
only, the ROM giant-ring destination.
