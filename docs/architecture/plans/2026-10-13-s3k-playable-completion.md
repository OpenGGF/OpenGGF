# S3K playable routes and endings, 2026-10-13

The requested completion target is playable game routes and endings, fixing
blockers first. Strict trace, audio and full-scene pixel parity remain separate
acceptance claims. The integration base is develop
`5e2f51f07917d5eff8ac120007dac55327f93f32`; unrelated main-workspace changes and
other worktrees are preserved.

## Work and acceptance

| Lane | Initial blocker evidence | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MHZ | Authored Tails/team pulley checks, wide world restoration and paired FBZ history isolation fail in the October stock audit | Reproduce current identities, distinguish runtime defects from entry/input/observation errors, and complete affected cold routes with restoration and forward replay |
| LRZ | Tails/team routes die; Knuckles/wide HPZ endpoints disagree | Resolve first blockers against ROM owners, qualify actual live destination and history isolation, retain unqualified breadth explicitly |
| SSZ | Sonic/team replica routes die; Tails child slots differ on replay and DEZ endpoint disagrees; wide team continuation is incomplete | Repair reachable native object/route behavior and prove production DEZ handoff; complete the outstanding wide continuation |
| DEZ | Positioned incoming final fights and emerald-team route die; ordinary routes disagree at ending entry | Qualify the actual full-load boundary and live roster, repair the first real fight blocker, and exercise normal and DDZ departures |
| Ending | No native rescue/credits owner for internal `$0D01`; Knuckles final defeat holds before native ending children | Implement the native Sonic/Tails rescue, Knuckles ending, progress-dependent credits/post-credits and terminal handoffs using ROM assets and registered rewind state |

Existing September milestones are historical evidence, not current passing
qualification. The October stock audit records the concrete inherited failing
identities. Early-zone matrices and trace frontiers are inspected to preserve
AIZ → HCZ stability; historical dedicated-trace failures do not automatically
become playable-route blockers.

## Native ending decisions

The initial generic-provider hypothesis is insufficient. In locked-on source,
`S3Credits` is an `rts`; DDZ requests an ordinary level load of `$0D01`, while
Knuckles' SSZ2 ending calls `sub_5B18E` inside its level. The implementation
must follow those game-owned event/object boundaries. Native progress is the
`-2/0/+2` marker from `sub_5FE82` for incomplete/Chaos/Super emerald progress,
not a substituted good/bad flag.

The owners to connect are `Ending_ScreenInit` / `Obj_5D86A`,
`loc_5E6C0`, `sub_5B18E`, and `Obj_5EF68`. Resource bytes must come through the
ROM pipeline. Source tables supply stages, timers, art, palette and mapping
selection; controller fixtures are comparison/verification inputs only.

## Validation and delivery

Use short, independent regressions for each cause, followed by the affected
cold controller routes and complete-world restore/replay windows. Observe the
current live player and actual load/title/fade boundary before interpreting a
fixed destination coordinate as a gameplay defect. Inspect moving ending
output at native and representative wide widths.

Combined validation uses the change-based smoke selection against the pinned
integration SHA and separate guards where required. Record class count, cost
and stopping rule before launching it. Java 25 is available and the existing
locked-on ROM has SHA-1 `CFBF98C36C776677290A872547AC47C53D2761D6`.
Preflight requires `LUA_BIN=/usr/bin/lua5.4` on this host; with that setting
the actual tool preflight passes. No release-only full suite is requested.

Update the owning per-act matrices and shared coverage/backlog only from
completed evidence. Merge verified lane commits into the development tree,
then into the main workspace's current develop branch without switching it;
push only integrated develop. Account for every owned worktree change before
removing fully merged task worktrees and branches.

## Execution record

The following execution entries preserve initial observations and rejected
approaches. Later completed evidence supersedes their pending labels; final
combined validation and delivery are recorded separately.

The first confirmed shared defect is the omitted fresh title presentation:
`FreshLevelTransitionBoundaryController` parks decoded destination players at
zero until its assembly is completed. `skipPendingInitialTitleCardPresentation`
consumed the request without completing that assembly. The short capture-session
regression fails on the untouched runtime with an orphaned boundary. Independent
LRZ and SSZ probes find the same current live P1 (not a cached reference) behind
the pending boundary. In HPZ, its zero Y also selects the upper-route camera
minimum. A candidate handoff now completes the assembly before the skipped
animation/PLC tail. The candidate passes seven cases with no failures, errors
or skips using `maven_queue.py --lean -Dmse=off` with the absolute locked-on
ROM and selectors `TestGameplayCaptureFreshLoad`,
`TestFreshLevelBoundaryRewindHeadless`, and `TestS3kLevelContinuationHeadless`
at 14:09 BST. Combined smoke and delivery remain pending.

Rejected explanation: replacing `GameplayCaptureSession.player()` references or
correcting endpoint coordinates would not publish destination state and would
retain the wrong HPZ camera branch. Cached/current/focused player identity is
equal in the independent witnesses.

MHZ baseline reproduction completes five cases with four assertion failures and
no errors/skips: authored Tails and team late-pulley ownership, paired FBZ history
isolation, and wide frame-19500 runtime deformation bytes after restoration.
The first short load regression completes one failure with no errors/skips.
Those are completed negative evidence; queued commands are not passes.

The [ending route matrix](../validation/levels/s3k-ending.md) records the native
rescue, fixed-slot plane/master/catcher, shared V-int/RNG cloud emitter, screen
and scroll RAM, AIZ/SSZ resource handoffs, progress-dependent credit decoder,
Knuckles flight and terminal obligations. Multiple build-only test compilations
pass. The initial four ROM-backed credits decoder cases pass; composed behavior,
new short regressions and moving output are still pending.

The first ending focused checks exposed two implementation defects. The rescue
plane was assigned a slot outside the current dynamic allocation window: native
`loc_5D96A` addresses `Dynamic_object_RAM+object_size*5` and `*45`, whose global
SST indices are 8 and 48 because that base follows three slots. The intermediate
5/45 translation also used the wrong base and was rejected directly from the
constants before verification. The actor-count regression rejects the original
missing-plane implementation. Separately, restoring an initial ending snapshot
ran the derived-parallax callback as a native background tick, changing its
captured `MIN_VALUE` dispatch marker and accumulator. The first correction, a
next-update flag on the handler, was rejected by the completed seven-case rerun:
two restoration assertions still changed the initial dispatch marker. Before the
first parallax update, the manager's active handler is unset, so that handler
never received the flag. The replacement is an internal `ScrollOutputRebuilder`
hook selected explicitly by post-restore reconciliation, including initial
handler setup; its focused rerun remains pending. Four pure deformation
arithmetic cases and three animal lifecycle
cases pass with no failures, errors or skips; these do not certify the complete
ending. The production D01 lifecycle cases follow actual phase boundaries,
both credit parts and Start return, rather than stopping at a fixed video length.

The MHZ wide movie enters `SPECIAL_STAGE` at input 19466 after missing the late
pulley. The mode changes the active camera while retaining the outgoing level.
Capturing that level registry and restoring it against the special-stage camera
explains the frame-19500 deformation mismatch; it is not evidence of a scroll
arithmetic defect. The route needs ordinary controller repair. Level replay
checkpoints now reject mode and fresh-load crossings before interpreting a
snapshot mismatch. The two unchanged LRZ Knuckles/wide-team routes reach live
Hidden Palace and pass their whole-world replay checks after the common assembly
fix (two cases, no failures, errors or skips).

The replacement wide MHZ movie has 29744 inputs. A fresh uninterrupted production
replay reaches the FBZ load at 28981 and released ordinary movement by the tail;
the whole-world replay test remains queued. Tails needs one additional held-right
input before its first Act2 jump: its 35815-input replacement reproduces the old
late pulley and flight positions with that input shift, requests FBZ at 35454,
and reaches the released destination in a fresh uninterrupted replay. The team
movie's first jump can be repaired similarly, but later curled-vine/badnik
navigation remains open. These production authoring observations used immutable
classes from `8438d7040`, the verified locked-on ROM and ordinary inputs only;
they are not substitutes for queued route/rewind qualification.

Ending footage exposed another composition defect despite nonzero CPU art and
ready renderers: the rescue plane's 6845 nonzero pattern pixels never reached its
virtual GPU atlas. Resident VRAM overlays mutate `Pattern` objects in place;
the identity-only cache does not observe those writes, and the new sheets had no
registered source tile range for the existing DMA refresh path. The replacement
registers that range rather than introducing another upload clock or art job.
An independent rendered-body check at 320/800 now accompanies the range oracle.
A separate pre-entry restore witness finds P1 `(96,300)` changed to `(0,0)` by an
uninitialized rescue director. Its restore callback now publishes scripted
presentation only after routine 0 has claimed P1. Verification remains pending.

The LRZ ring-counter investigation rejected two tempting explanations before any
runtime patch. Native LRZ saves counters before `StartNewLevel` and restores them
at its destination event. The observed sequence is ring5 before the load, ring0
on the load-producing tick, then ring5 on the first destination event and later
ticks. Neither the ordinary clear alone nor a suspected deferred-assembly erase
explains the released boundary. Retain the native carry assertion and repair the
controller approach to the actual fight.

Main develop advanced to `b3464b31b` with two documentation-only commits. Fetch
and fast-forward pull report up to date; root merge `4846db63e` reconciles the
coordination guidance and Chaos research. Runtime source is unchanged by those
commits, so the pinned pre-task source baseline remains `5e2f51f079`.

The MHZ team repair now has 44004 ordinary inputs. A fresh uninterrupted
production replay (immutable `8438d7040` runtime) passes all inputs without a
death, reaches the actual FBZ load at 43234 and ends with live Sonic `(201,1219)`
and a registered Tails follower in the released destination. The repair uses a
spindash around the lower loop, sustained jumps past the upper spikes, a release
on the swing vine's rightward arc, and a brake into the shared final pulley.
Both players first occupy the shared handle at 35047 and reach its top at 35734.
Repeated short jumps and release at the vine's low arc were rejected: they lose
rings at the badnik or fall into the lower bowl before the upper passage. The
legacy boss suffix still defeats the boss; its original capsule approach misses
the button, so the replacement explicitly opens it and observes ship carry.
The committed script is recompiled with `InputLogAuthorTool`; its Input Log
bytes are identical to the selected authoring movie. Native Sonic/Tails/team
whole-registry checks and paired live-history isolation are queued together;
this production observation is not their passing qualification.

A bounded current source/resource audit finds no additional missing native exit
owner beyond these repair lanes. Earlier backlog references to SOZ Knuckles Act2
and DEZ800 Act2 are superseded by their later dated entries: fixed 35315/35440
SOZ2 Knuckles movies and two 48-window tests reach LRZ through `loc_77A3E` /
`loc_77A5E`; the 53564-input DEZ800 Act2 movie and its 110-window test reach
`$1700`. The separate 60298-input ordinary wide DEZ ending route also exists.
This audit establishes current source/input availability, not new execution
proof or complete native-presentation/breadth certification. Combined validation
will report the actual tested identities and inherited gaps.

The bounded ending breadth now also covers the actual five viewport presets:
thirty supported S1/S2 donor reunion vectors and thirty configured roster entry
checks (Sonic/Tails, duplicate/mixed/large follower lists). The roster checks
compare every registered snapshot key before retirement, after entry and after
forward replay, then reload ordinary AIZ and verify roster and render origin.
The seven-follower row is a large configured team, not a claimed maximum: the
current configuration parser has no explicit participant cap. The first test-only
build caught an omitted `IOException` declaration for that reload; no tests ran.
After its correction, Java25 `maven_queue.py -Dmse=off test-compile -B` passes
at 16:33 BST (22.675s). Formal source-frozen checks remain queued; this build is
not their outcome.


### Completed focused evidence and restore corrections, 2026-10-13

The repaired MHZ800 cold route passes its complete one-case qualification with
25 named whole-world restore/replay spots, both cycles and retained horizons,
zero failures/errors/skips (development tree with the revised 29744-input movie,
completed 16:42:43 BST).
Command: `python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off` with the absolute
verified S3K ROM and `-Dtest=TestMhzWideColdRouteCapture`, `test -B` in
`ai-s3k-playable-finish`. The native three-character and paired-history checks
remain in their existing queued request; this result does not imply their pass.

The SSZ lane's six selected cold/complete routes pass with no failures, errors
or skips: Tails native/wide (16:37:58), solo/team replica routes (16:38:32),
team complete (16:41:11) and solo complete (16:45:58). Their repaired inputs,
assertions and exact commands are committed in `f01268432`, integrated here as
`99486686f`. The mandatory release/control/roster assertions were retained.
The destination ring publication fix passes 14 boundary cases and all 60
mandatory S3K startup cases, no skips, in `f7d1aea0b` (here `71b357e7a`).
Among four current LRZ pair/HPZ checks, three pass; only the intermediate
`TestLrzActTwoColdRouteCapture` door 6 at 39980 assertion is still under
investigation. Tails' first Act2 climb also still needs controller repair.

Ending GPU rescue-body checks pass at 320/800 (2 cases). Native cloud, scene
resource, pure scroll and parallax restoration checks pass 13 cases, and ordinary
render-origin reset checks pass 19. Five-width credit Plane A plus exact PLC
mapping and renderer corruption checks pass 8. Post-credits dispatch plus the
ordinary Mecha-spark neighbor pass 7. These are bounded checks of their named
owners, with no skips; they do not certify an entire ending lifecycle.

Composed rescue and lifecycle negatives identified real rewind gaps. Retiring
permanent followers at native rescue entry lost them when restoring the
pre-entry roster. A derived resource registry now retains complete wired
followers while captured membership determines which are active; fresh world
loads clear retained bindings. Calling a missing one-argument construction
probe also dropped Super Tails' captured flock before its existing owner codec
could restore it. The native reunion RAM clear (loc_5ABC0/loc_5AD8E) erases the
fixed Shield slot while retaining P1; stale registration intent manufactured
an InstaShield after restore. Native auxiliary retirement now clears that handle
and intent, and generic reconciliation preserves a captured absent auxiliary
while keeping explicit pending-handle restoration. Focused reruns are pending.
No permanent follower is relabeled temporary, and no snapshot entry is filtered.

Independent moving footage found native Camera_X reset to 0 with retained 459
arena words at the wide Knuckles credits/terminal. Masking the stale world
interval hid the native centre 400 body. A semantic screen presentation origin
now places only the mask at 240..560, leaving native camera bounds unchanged.
The initial flight's gray flanks are intentional arena-mask grain, so treating
Pattern0 as corrupt was rejected. Negative-progress credit completion also
needed the native loc_5B2CE cloud-emission-mask clear; velocity words survive
and already allocated clouds retire naturally. A new actual-fight-to-terminal
GPU regression checks the real ROM Mecha pixels, native words and emitter
retirement. Its qualification remains pending.

The initial short graph/width checks had fixture defects: unprojected native
camera 0 at wide widths, a child-pressure slot outside the managed4..93 range,
and native routine 0 allocation incorrectly treated as initialized progress.
The affected fixtures now declare their actual native camera/dispatch boundary.
Tails' Chaos-only rescue takes native routine 8 without Super activation or a
50-ring award; that incorrect donor oracle is corrected. The composed effect
restore failures above were preserved and fixed as runtime defects.

Develop's verified queue update `4a9bec1ea` is merged here as `2e992da7d`.
All three workers received the coordination update. Existing requests remain
alive without duplicates; subsequent focused invocations use the updated main
wrapper from the intended tree. Combined coverage will use this tree's updated
local category runner, retaining the complete selection while yielding admission
between batches of at most 50 candidates and before guards. Required surfaceless
EGL flags remain set. This is an admission opportunity, not a runtime ceiling.
The original integration pin remains unchanged.


### Native Knuckles campaign admission audit

The September MHZ Knuckles exclusions are historical task scope, not an
exclusion from this playable-game completion. Source contains the native
Knuckles switch/miniboss/end-boss/FBZ owners, but a cold MHZ1→2→FBZ route remains
unqualified. The source-only suggestion that these owners implied no concrete
MHZ blocker was rejected by the actual cold production probe below.

At the pinned initial baseline, LBZ has a separate concrete prerequisite:
the placed `$CD` upper-arena entry is an unconditional placeholder. Verified placement bytes `4410 8440 CD00` at
ROM `$1F11CC` belong to native `Obj_LBZFinalBossKnux` / `word_72FEA`. Existing
`$CA` / `$CC` Big Arm/carrier tests manually insert the later owner and bypass
this admission. Its native gate must precede the same-slot `$CA` transition;
the `$328` target comes from the second bounds record and survives into carrier
escape. A character-only `$CA` activation wait is also being checked against
`loc_72A54` / `loc_72A5A`. The isolated LBZ lane preserves a frozen negative
candidate while implementing the owning gate and timer continuation separately.
No manually inserted later boss certifies this actual entry.

A fresh native320 Knuckles MHZ production probe, immutable jar SHA256
`5e301d171c582d4d0cf26fc05b14e821e6e29fcdb02f585119870ccafb2c9ff7`, runtime
source SHA256`0ea2ae103a353717b07a8db96e26d3c4bc5cb17ebd8f34d4d4d9dc547e71af9e`,
uses the existing23775-input ordinary Sonic movie without gameplay seeds. It
remains alive but stationary at `1269/2604` from about input 1000 to its end,
with camera`$560/$948`. Independent up/left/jump candidates cannot release it.
The placed `CutsceneKnucklesSkIntroInstance` seizes control because it checks
Knuckles and checkpoint state but omits native `SK_alone_flag`. Primary
`CutsceneKnux_SKIntro` explicitly BEQ-deletes for flag0 before any camera/P1
writes. The supported locked-on ROM always has0; playing as Knuckles is a
separate prerequisite. Independent source adjudication agrees with the gate.

The runtime spawn constructor now supplies the supported false ROM mode;
standalone component fixtures explicitly supply true and retain their existing
lifecycle assertions. The mode is ordinary captured state rather than derived
only from spawn, preserving generic reconstruction. A short actual-ROM placed
owner regression at 320/352/400/528/800 captures/restores/replays its manager
boundary before any long route. The raw `$5C3/$9F5` placement is verified from
Object Pos/1.bin: its complete block matches ROM `$1F2296`, row 270. The earlier
CSV's `$5B7` was the object's moved spawn after twelve leftward steps, not the
ROM placement; that tentative test oracle was corrected before qualification.

The corrected source compiles. An immutable patched production replay passes
the old lock point, follows ordinary camera motion, and reaches the next lower
loop with live Knuckles by input 1000. Continuous right input preserves momentum
through that loop; repeated jumps lose it. Avoiding the next spike blower still
needs controller authoring. These author observations are not passing route or
rewind qualification. The gate/17 explicit standalone fixtures and new loaded
width cases are in their unique queued focused request.

A separate ending production probe rejects the apparent full-centre grain as an
intentional wait: Tails Super departure at 2500–3700 keeps physical Camera_X=0
while `foregroundPosition` deliberately publishes render-copy608. The screen
mask origin and screen-actor compensation used physical words, hiding the native
centre. The local correction uses the renderer's copies+shake while preserving
physical/copy RAM and native-world Knuckles motion. This is distinct from the
already corrected retained459 terminal bounds and intentional gray flanks.

One retired-roster request ended unexpectedly with exit 143 while still waiting;
its log had no admission or tests. Cause remains unobserved. It is incomplete,
not a pass or JUnit failure. A single replacement uses the updated wrapper;
all other live requests were retained without duplicates.

The repaired MHZ Sonic, Tails and team authored routes passed all three full-world replay cases on `2e992da7d` plus the current route and locked-on intro changes (request 62839, 2026-10-13 17:51 BST, zero skips). The separate paired live-history case failed its outgoing-history prerequisite: its end-relative activation at input 43524 was after the actual FBZ load at input 43234. This was a fixture sequencing error, not a history-manager defect. Activate at the already authored live capsule approach, input 41705, and retain the outgoing history and actual destination reset assertions. Only the changed paired case needs rerunning.

The native intro gate and existing MHZ cutscene checks pass 93 cases with no
failures, errors or skips (request 78871, 18:02:16 BST). Independent review
confirms the three native prerequisites and captured standalone fixture mode.
The paired MHZ live-history rerun passes one case at 18:04:43 BST (request 50505,
48.141 seconds Maven), retaining actual outgoing history and load isolation.
Qualified LRZ paired continuation and Tails Act1 evidence are integrated as
`a1cf9181c` and `7144c7618`; the later Tails Act2 route remains in authoring.


### Integrated native owners and remaining qualification, 2026-10-13

The native ending feature `c2103d5f7` is integrated as `d63bfe397` after merging
current develop `1ead8d9b4` in `bfdf381a2`. The upstream AIZ native dispatch slots,
drawbridge standing latch and selected-world physics-profile initialization are
preserved. DDZ roster retirement, pure restored scroll output and seven
continuous incoming scenarios are integrated from `3a9e6252a` as `1fab3806c`.
Focused D01 lifecycle/roster/projection checks pass 48 cases without skips;
Knuckles lifecycle/transition/donor/graph checks pass 58, and native scene-clear
and auxiliary-owner regressions pass 2 and 33 respectively. These are bounded
qualification, not full-scene native parity. The ending matrix records the
individual commands, source states and corrected fixture-only premises.

The placed LBZ gate `efbef3d38` is integrated as `976863de8`. Its initial
five-width negative witness resolves CD to a placeholder. The corrected actual
ROM placement admits native camera bounds, retains the negative CD music timer
across same-slot CA initialization, and captures exact parent/sibling edges
through pure child reconstruction. Fifty-seven entry/schema cases, 60 mandatory
S3K startup cases and ten carrier graph cases pass without skips. Positioned
CD→CA→CC→capsule/results/floor/carrier→released MHZ composition passes; its last
ordinary Right-input assertion was corrected from an accidentally neutral mask
and rerun independently. This does not establish a cold LBZ traversal or every
transient detached-child/allocation prefix. See the [LBZ2 matrix](../validation/levels/s3k-lbz-act2.md).

LRZ Tails' repaired first-act and middle routes are integrated as `7144c7618`
and `c67886b74`; their production whole-world checks pass. Late Tails boss/HPZ
and the cold Knuckles MHZ1→2→FBZ controller route remain in authoring. Knuckles
passes the corrected standalone-mode gate, actual lower vine, upper pulley and
reaches the real six-hit MHZ1 miniboss alive without gameplay-state seeds.
These observations do not yet certify the complete route.

The current change-based plan against the original integration pin selects all
ten smoke categories (3,201 candidate classes before the remaining route test),
with batches of at most 50 and separate guards. Root owns combined validation;
workers run focused checks. No broad run or integration push has completed yet.


The final LRZ Tails continuation `f52eb1810` is integrated as `f2b4962a6`.
Its final 53,259/62,524-input movies exactly preserve the qualified 36,714-input
incoming prefix. Three focused methods pass with zero failures/errors/skips at
19:02:16 BST (37.95 seconds in class, 1:02 minutes Maven): actual Act1 history
isolation, 71 Act2 and 62 boss/HPZ whole-world windows, all fourteen boss-health
states, earned FIRE/ring12 approach, capsule/results, no encounter hurt and
released HPZ `393/2800/ring3`. The raw cross-act registry checkpoint was invalid
across an intentional seamless history barrier; the apparently active second
fade was produced by a callback-bearing authoring fork. Fresh uninterrupted
replay and the checkpoint guard reject that fork as evidence of a runtime PLC
or history defect.

Cold Knuckles ordinary rapid fresh jump presses defeat the real MHZ1 miniboss
at input 28613 and reach MHZ2 at 29044. Native body `$CF` has a 32-dispatch hit
cooldown, while flame children `$9A` remain independently harmful during body
hit-flash and use V-int parity; longer airborne re-presses also trigger glide.
Sonic's long jump cadence therefore cannot be assumed suitable for Knuckles.
These are controller choices, not changes to physics or damage handling.
The new 30,000-input Act1 fixture is byte-identical to its selected uninterrupted
production prefix and reaches released Act2 without a death.

The first formal Knuckles check, request 36128, completes one error, zero
assertion failures/skips at 19:00:15 BST (19.40 seconds class, 1:29 minutes Maven)
on `fd46e1bed` plus the new controller test/resources. Actual live history after
the MHZ2 load captures `Mhz2KnucklesRouteSwitchChild#parent`, which refers to the
immediately deleted Knuckles parent and has no registered rewind identity.
This is a real ownership defect, not a reason to disable live history. Native
`loc_6311A` creates the switch and deletes the parent; `loc_632CA` gives the
Knuckles switch its own position/frame/respawn state and `Sprite_OnScreen_Test`.
Only Sonic/Tails keep `loc_63308` / `Child_Draw_Sprite` and a live parent edge.
A short actual-ROM ownership regression and pure shell correction are in the
isolated worker; the unchanged full controller assertions will be rerun after
integration. Later MHZ2 input authoring remains independent of that correction.


The switch fix `3596237c3` is integrated as `bed44fae6`; 173 short entry/cutscene/
graph/startup cases pass at 19:08:47 BST, no skips. The unchanged 30,000-input cold
Knuckles Act1 test then passes one case at 19:16:41 BST (21.40 seconds class,
1:32 minutes Maven), covering 43 two-cycle whole-world windows, every health
value and actual seamless history retirement. Source includes current develop
`843aa4738` reconciled without conflicts in `accf871d9`: native placement patches,
optional S3K difficulty contracts and their candidate API pins are preserved.
No stock rule or authoring-input change was made to accommodate those upstream
contracts. The original combined selection pin remains `5e2f51f079`.


### MHZ native terminal ownership and current route replay

The cold Knuckles authoring prefix exposed a real terminal mismatch: after an
admitted final hit, the old owner retained health one indefinitely instead of
starting native escape. `sub_76782` runs after movement, including the same-update
`loc_760C4` arena admission. Its pre-arena health floor therefore belongs in that
tail, not immediately in the collision callback. `loc_767F6` / `loc_76822` starts
escape at health one after the 32-dispatch flash; a ninth hit to zero is not the
ROM contract. The correction preserves character-specific speed, the `$3F`
underflow wait, clock stop before score, and the fractional low word while
`loc_761A4` applies arena repetition after the unrebased escape threshold.
Worker `e3dc92ea5` integrates as `b143f272e`; 169 affected boss, native damage,
graph and schema checks pass at 20:53:51 BST with no failures, errors or skips.
The 60 mandatory startup checks passed on the same normal boss owner at
20:45:17 BST; later exact-parent reconstruction does not change normal offsets.

The hit proxy now recreates its captured placement and exact captured boss
reference. A two-live-boss negative proved the nearest-parent factory selected
another owner. An earlier single-parent spawn mismatch was incomplete fixture
dispatch: advancing the real moving parent and proxy together passed without
that metadata change. Treating it as a production spawn-drift defect was rejected.

On root `b143f272e` plus the native health assertions, the command below passes
four cases at 21:05:03 BST, zero failures, errors or skips: native Sonic, solo
Tails, native Sonic/Tails and paired live-history isolation. This is focused
qualification before the subsequent native child-retirement follow-up; final
combined source verification remains pending.

```bash
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl LUA_BIN=/usr/bin/lua5.4 ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off '-Dtest=TestS3kMhzAct2AuthoredRoute,TestMhzPairColdRouteCapture' "-Ds3k.rom.path=$S3K_TASK_ROM" test -B
```

Independent full-drawing controller replay on the immutable `b143f272e` runtime
jar observes wide Sonic health nine through one, terminal flash at input 24797,
escape at 24828, and the actual FBZ load at 28981. Cold native Knuckles retains
the qualified 30,000-input Act1 prefix, reaches terminal health one at 63690,
escapes at 63721 and loads FBZ at 66053. Input 66054 publishes the actual
destination at `(96,1900)`, rings zero, and accepts ordinary right input.
The selected safe endpoint at 66270 is grounded at `(779,1388)` with seven earned
rings. These producer observations do not substitute for the new full-route
world-replay and timeline-isolation contract, whose qualification is pending.

Read-only review also identifies a native lifetime gap: `loc_76164` publishes
parent status bit seven at `$44D0` while retaining the boss body. Both
`Child_AddToTouchList` and spike `loc_76674` consume that signal and retire their
children. The previous Java children only tested actual parent destruction;
the misleading status-bit fixture tested that fallback. A captured local owner
signal and graph-before/after regression are being qualified separately. The
head's `$38` bit five and weather machine's own child owner remain distinct.


The retirement follow-up `2688b2cf1` integrates as `f9ac22318`. Its174 affected
native/component/graph/schema checks pass at21:11:56 BST with no failures,
errors or skips. The native-threshold negatives fail exactly on the still-live
proxy and spikes. Independent subtype negatives prove nearest-parent spike
recreation can select another boss; captured placement and exact links now
retain the real owner. A new explosion replay initially omitted the fixture's
production RNG from its bounded registry; registering that existing RNG resolves
the failure without changing production behavior or weakening comparisons.

Final source `f9ac22318` plus the controller tests passes two cases at21:15:27 BST
(1:57 Maven, zero failures/errors/skips): the new cold native320 Knuckles full
chain and the existing800px Sonic chain. Knuckles's66271-input movie preserves
all30000 Act1 inputs, remains alive without transformation or hidden respawn,
visits every native boss health value9..1 and escapes at one, restores/replays
22 Act2 windows twice and isolates live history at the actual FBZ load66053.
Its final grounded FBZ endpoint has seven earned rings and released movement.
The separate Act1 contract retains43 two-cycle windows. Wide Sonic retains all
25 windows, health9..1 and actual load28981 with released ordinary FBZ control.
The exact focused command is:

```bash
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl LUA_BIN=/usr/bin/lua5.4 ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off '-Dtest=TestMhzWideColdRouteCapture,TestMhzKnucklesColdRouteCapture#coldKnucklesCompletesActTwoAndIsolatesTheFbzTimeline' "-Ds3k.rom.path=$S3K_TASK_ROM" test -B
```

These are completed bounded controller/rewind results, not whole-game parity or
all viewport/donor/lifecycle certification. The earlier native Sonic/Tails/team
four-case pass is before the retirement follow-up; final combined smoke includes
those identities on the consolidated source. No strict trace frontier is moved.


### Consolidated ending presentation and combined launch

Ending repair `f664a1e1a` is merged normally as `7df0c44cb`, retaining the
original `c2103d5f7` capture commit in ancestry. Only the independently appended
ROM pitfall sections conflict; both are retained in identical skill mirrors.
No bootstrap-physics or candidate API change is overwritten. The lane qualifies
50 distinct affected checks across completed runs, with no unresolved failures,
errors or skips; this is not a claim of one50-case invocation. IslandLift's
ROM art/animation graph, independent Master Emerald palette helper and explicit
AIZ hold palette owner close the three previously catalogued omissions.
The [ending matrix](../validation/levels/s3k-ending.md#repaired-native-presentation-owners--2026-10-13)
records allocation/rewind, publication-generation pixel premises and inherited
unchecked full-capacity SST-overwrite emulation. Two new85-second excerpts
(Sonic Chaos320 and Tails Super800) have completed CSV/video/hash/full-decode
checks; the original films and their historical source identities are preserved.

The updated local category runner's complete change-based plan against original
integration base `5e2f51f07917d5eff8ac120007dac55327f93f32` selects3214 candidate
classes across all ten ordinary smoke categories and separate guards. The shared
and upstream changes justify that complete selection; no manual narrowing is
used. The actual launch environment's Java25/Lua5.4/PowerShell preflight passed
at19:27 BST; required EGL/null-audio flags and correct existing absolute ROM
paths remain in place. Main develop fetch/fast-forward check at21:18 BST remains
`5d9dd8138`, already included in the development ancestry.

Expected ROM-backed execution cost is60–120 minutes, in65 batches of at most50
candidate classes, followed by fresh guards. Queue waiting is excluded from the
combined120-minute execution limit; ten minutes without output is the no-output
stopping rule. A timeout is incomplete validation, not a pass. The lead owns this
one combined run; workers perform no duplicate broad checks. Source edits remain
frozen while its worktree lease is live. Final failures/skips will be inspected
by identity, disputed failures attributed by bounded matched tests, and consumed
run diagnostics acknowledged before delivery. Packaging uses`-DskipTests`
after the required validation.

```bash
env -u DISPLAY -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dopenggf.headless.gl=surfaceless-egl LUA_BIN=/usr/bin/lua5.4 ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null python3 tools/testing/run_categories.py --base 5e2f51f07917d5eff8ac120007dac55327f93f32 --rom-directory "$S3K_TASK_ROM_DIRECTORY" --max-minutes 120 --run
```

`S3K_TASK_ROM_DIRECTORY` denotes the original main checkout containing the three
verified user ROMs. This launch plan is not a completed smoke/guard result.
Integration into develop, push and owned-worktree cleanup remain pending.


## Pinned upstream composition, 2026-10-14

The retained task smoke source is `7d0a9acbb`, based on destination
`5d9dd8138`; it does not qualify later upstream code. An isolated integration
branch first merges the qualified ending follow-ups through `c893df427`, then
pinned upstream `ea8c9c627`. The ending merge preserves the retained route
owners and changes only `SwScrlEnding`, its resource contract test and the
stale title-card reflection fixture under `src/`. The upstream delta has 309
paths, with 18,512 added and 843 removed lines.

The upstream merge automatically combines all eight intersecting runtime
owners: `GameLoop`, `Sonic3kGameModule`, `Sonic3kObjectArtProvider`,
`EggRoboBadnikInstance`, `LevelManager`, `SpriteManager`,
`SpriteManagerInternalAccess` and `AbstractPlayableSprite`. The sole textual
conflict is the coverage backlog introduction: retain both the task's playable
completion record and upstream's issue-sweep/Chaos records. No owner is replaced
wholesale. In particular, preserve the ending Start/white-entry semantics,
resident-art DMA refresh registration, reversible follower retirement, captured
InstaShield absence and fresh render-origin reset alongside upstream policy,
motion and hurt-landing changes.

The behavioral risks are composed consumers, despite clean Java merges:
upstream changes setup-only host input-edge consumption, ordinary native-tick
policy hooks and accepted world-history replay, motion/fluid bindings for newly
registered roster members, S2/S3K native hurt landing through object control,
and shared SAT/priority/background-FBO/shader rendering. Stock worlds without
prepared mutator definitions retain a null policy graph; this limits active
Chaos mechanics to configured content, but does not remove the shared drawing
and input changes. The new capture launch/decorator and optional presentation
pacing paths also require their normal CLI consumers; old media keeps its
original immutable source and is not relabeled as combined-source parity.

Upstream executable tree `a2280d37b:src` equals `ea8c9c627:src`
(`534374ca3d17755a6001dfd4ba6f9662a6ddeeee`); the [issue-sweep record](../validation/2026-10-13-github-issues.md)
records 383 movement/API/rewind/loading cases, ten graphics cases, nine SOZ
routes and 680 fresh guards, all without failures, errors or skips. These are
completed unchanged upstream baseline checks, not proof for this combined
source. The earlier Chaos broad run retains its dated, matched inherited reds;
CI EGL package provisioning has no recorded hosted-run result here.

Build and final validation remain lead-owned delivery gates. Inspect the
change-based smoke selection from the original pre-task destination `5e2f51f079`
after composition; shared movement/history/rendering changes justify a new
source qualification rather than repeating unchanged task checks. Preserve
exact test identities and skips when comparing the retained run and upstream
baseline. Focused ending entry/Start, roster/effect reverse restore, D01 and
actual Knuckles terminal lifecycles, changed presentation pixels, and real cold
route/handoff consumers should run on the composed source wherever they are
outside the selected smoke lane. Do not add another broad baseline run or infer
native scene conformance from these bounded checks.


The isolated merge commits are `b01eaeb6a` (ending) and `b01a0c665`
(upstream). On the composed `b01a0c665` source, build-only
`python3 tools/testing/maven_queue.py -Dmse=off compile` succeeds at
00:13:39 BST on 2026-10-14: 3,964 production sources, Java release 25,
50.669 seconds Maven time, no tests executed. The normal hooks and exact final
coauthor parse passed both merges; all eight Java intersections were automatic.

The read-only plan command
`python3 tools/testing/run_categories.py --base 5e2f51f079 --json` selects
3,253 of 3,253 smoke candidate classes across all ten categories: 66 ordinary
batches of at most 50 classes plus the separate fresh guard lane. This is the
complete bounded smoke selection, not the public-release full suite. The
ending lifecycle/Knuckles/pixel/entry/donor/roster, changed native ROM-table,
MHZ/DEZ/LRZ/SSZ route and PLC-registry consumers are present in that selection;
`TestPatternSpriteRendererCorruptionGuard` belongs to the separate guard lane.
The lead still owns preflight in the actual launch environment, execution cost
and stopping rule, identity-by-identity comparison, integration and push. No
engine test or new broad run is started by this preparation work.
