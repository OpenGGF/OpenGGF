# MICA art surfaces

The playable sheet has 274 frames, 53 animation keys. Runtime art is indexed with transparency
at index zero. [Shared art rules and build commands](../../README.md) apply.
Paths below are relative to this directory; run repository tool commands from
the repository root. `assemble.py` is `tools/modding/playable_art/assemble.py`.

| Surface | Files | Method | How to regenerate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `competition/` | 44 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `competition-menu/` | 2 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `continue/` | 53 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `endings/` | 60 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `hud-and-screens/` | 28 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `portrait/` | 1 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `powered/` | 94 PNGs | Host-specific native-pose powered sheets | Run `assemble.py` for each `powered/s2` and `powered/s3k` handoff into a target directory. |
| `reels/` | 2 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `sheet/` | 274 PNGs | Approved native-pose drawings and deterministic slopes | `assemble.py art/mica/sheet <target-output>` packages the handoff; it does not redraw approved frames. |
| `snowboard/` | 13 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `special-stage/` | 72 PNGs | Canonical indexed parts, native body motion and joint placements | `python3 tools/modding/playable_art/locked_stage.py examples/mica-and-talon/production/mica/consistent-stage --check` (omit `--check` to rebuild). |
| `stage-poses/` | 35 PNGs | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |
| `titles/` | 51 PNGs; masks and clear mask | Selected native-pose generation, locked palette and native hotspots | Use the matching production recipe/manifest and selected indexed rows; raw input paths in provenance require the original external scratch inputs. |

Production records are in [`production/mica/`](../../production/mica/).
The final special-stage manifests point from that tree to these approved PNGs.
The remaining scripts record individual production steps and may require external
raw generations or ROM references; the ordinary build never runs them. Changes
to approved drawings need the native-style and render checks described above.
